Fly
===

An object of the ``Fly`` class is an instance of a simulated fly. There can be multiple flies in a `Simulation <simulation.html>`_. The ``Fly`` object contains parameters related to the fly but not the whole simulation: for example, the set of actuated joints, spawn position, joint actuator parameters (stiffness, damping, etc.), and initial pose.
