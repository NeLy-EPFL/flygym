.. warning::
   
   This package is still under development. **Only the MuJoCo version is available**. The API is subject to change.


This package implements `Gymnasium`_ environments for NeuroMechFly (`paper`_, `code`_), a neuromechanical model of the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*.

Gymnasium is "a standard API [(Application Programming Interface)] for reinforcement learning, and a diverse collection of reference environments."

The environments in this package serve as wrappers to provide a unified interface to interact with fly model in different physics simulators (MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, PyBullet). The goal is to provide a consolidated API like the following to interact with the fly simulation::

   env = MyEnvironment(...)
   obs = env.reset()

   for step in range(1000):
      action = ...    # your controller decides what to do based on obs
      obs, info = env.step(action)
      env.render()

   env.close()
