FlyGym is the Python library for NeuroMechFly 2.0, a digital twin of the adult fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* that can see, smell, walk over challenging terrain, and interact with the environment (see our `NeuroMechFly 2.0 paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.18.556649>`_).

FlyGym consists of the following components:

- **Biomechanical model:** The biomechanical model is based on a micro-CT scan of a real adult female fly (see our `original NeuroMechFly <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01466-7>`_ publication). We have adjusted several body segments (in particular in the antennae) to better reflect the biological reality.
- **Vision:** The fly has compound eyes consisting of individual units called ommatidia arranged on a hexagonal lattice. We have simulated the visual inputs on the fly's retinas.
- **Olfaction:** The fly has odor receptors in the antennae and the maxillary palps. We have simulated the odor inputs experienced by the fly by computing the odor/chemical intensity at these locations.
- **Hierarchical control:** The fly's Central Nervous System consists of the brain and the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), a hierarchy analogous to our brain-spinal cord organization. The user can build a two-part model --- one handling brain-level sensory integration and decision making and one handling VNC-level motor control --- with a interface between the two consisting of descending (brain-to-VNC) and ascending (VNC-to-brain) representations.
- **Leg adhesion:** Insects have evolved specialized adhesive structures at the tips of the legs that enable locomotion vertical walls and overhanging ceilings. We have simulated these structures in our model. The mechanism by which the fly lifts the legs during locomotion despite adhesive forces is not well understood; to abstract this, adhesion can be turned on/off during leg stance/swing.
- **Mechanosensory feedback:** The user has access to the joint angles, forces, and contact forces experienced by the fly.

FlyGym formulates the control of the simulated fly as a `partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process>`_ and implements the `Gym interface <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`_. This allows the user to use a wide range of reinforcement learning algorithms to train the fly to perform tasks. The standardized interface also allows the user to easily implement their own premotor computation and/or sensory preprocessing processes.

   *The biomechanical model and its interaction with the environment are encapsulated as a MDP task. A user-defined controller interfaces with the task through actions (red) and observations (blue). The user can extend the MDP task by adding preprogrammed processing routines for sensory inputs (purple) and motor outputs (light blue), to modify the action and observation spaces handled by the controller.*
