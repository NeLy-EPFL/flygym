Simulation Parameters
=====================

Parameters of the simulation, including physics parameters (eg. friction, graivty) and visualization parameters (eg. render mode, render FPS), are defined in the ``MuJoCoParameters`` class. This class, however, does not include parameters that are specific to the NeuroMechFly model itself (eg. which body segments are included in collision tracking, where the model is spawned at the beginning of the simulation).
