    `notebooks folder of the FlyGym repository <https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/flygym/tree/main/notebooks>`_.

**Summary:** In this tutorial, we will introduce the basic concepts of
interacting with the simulated fly in a Markov Decision Process using
the Gym interface. As a demonstration, we will replay experimentally
recorded leg kinematics during walking in the simulator.

Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the Gym API
---------------------------------------------

We formulated the control of NeuroMechFly as a partially observable
Markov Decision Process (MDP). At each time step, the simulation
provides the controller with an observation and, optionally, a
user-defined reward. Then, the simulation receives an action from the
controller and steps the physics forward accordingly. The observation
space is a user-configurable subset of the state space including visual
inputs, olfactory inputs, ground contacts, joint states (angles, angular
velocities, and torques), and the position and velocity of the fly model
within the arena. The action space includes the control signal
(e.g. angles for position control) for every actuated joint (e.g. 7
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) per leg \* 6 legs) and the on/off signal for
leg adhesion. This framework is easily extendable: the user can
incorporate additional layers of sensory preprocessing or premotor
computation into the MDP.

| *The biomechanical model and its interaction with the environment are |
| encapsulated as a MDP task. A user-defined controller interfaces with |
| the task through actions (red) and observations (blue). The user can  |
| extend the MDP task by adding preprogrammed processing routines for   |
| motor outputs (purple) and sensory inputs (light blue), to modify the |
| action and observation spaces handled by the controller.*             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Our implementation of the partially observable MDP complies with the
`Gymnasium API <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__. Gymnasium (a
continuation of the now deprecated OpenAI Gym) is a package and
standardized interface for developing and comparing control algorithms
and benchmarking tasks. It provides a diverse collection of
environments, ranging from classic control problems, Atari games, board
games, and robotics simulations. Gym environments are designed to offer
a common interface for controllers, in particular reinforcement learning
agents, to interact with. This standardization makes it easier to
develop and compare algorithms.

The overall steps for interacting with a Gym environment are:

1. Defining an environment
2. Reset the environment and get the initial observation
3. Interact with the environment with a loop:

   -  Based on the last observation, the controller decides which
      actions to take
   -  Step the simulation, applying the selected actions. The simulation
      will return you the new observation (and optionally some
      additional information)
   -  Optional: render the simulation graphically
   -  Break if certain conditions are met (e.g. task is accomplished or
      failed), otherwise continue

4. Close the environment and analyze the results

This process is illustrated in the following code snippet:

.. code:: python

   env = MyEnvironment(...)
   obs, info = env.reset()

   for step in range(1000):    # let's simulate 1000 steps max
       action = ...    # your controller decides what to do based on obs
       obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
       env.render()
       if terminated or truncated:
           break

   env.close()

Note that the action can be selected by any means defined by the user
(e.g. preprogrammed rules, algorithmic models, artificial neural
networks).

MDP specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to the
``"MPD Task Specifications" page <https://neuromechfly.org/api_ref/mdp_specs.html#default-simulation>``\ \_
of the API references for the detailed specifications of the action
space, the observation space, the reward, the “terminated” and
“truncated” flags, and the “info” dictionary.

Example: Kinematic replay of experimentally recorded behavior
-------------------------------------------------------------

We now move on to an example where we kinematically replay some
experimentally recorded walking behaviors. Specifically, we recorded a
tethered fly walking on an air-suspended spherical treadmill using seven
zoomed-in cameras from different angles. We then estimated the 3D
positions of keypoints on the joints using DeepFly3D (Günel et al.,
*Elife* 2019) and used inverse kinematics to calculate the angle at each
DoF. With these we will use a PD controller to actuate the DoFs of the
simulated fly at using these exact angles to see if the fly can walk
untethered on flat terrain, as shown in the original NeuroMechFly paper
(Lobato-Rios et al., *Nature Methods* 2022).

We start with the necessary imports:

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    import pickle
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from pathlib import Path
    from tqdm import trange
    
    from flygym import Fly, ZStabilizedCamera, SingleFlySimulation, get_data_path
    from flygym.preprogrammed import all_leg_dofs

Let’s define some simulation parameters:

.. code:: ipython3

    run_time = 1
    timestep = 1e-4
    actuated_joints = all_leg_dofs

We can now load recorded kinematics that are included with the FlyGym
package:

.. code:: ipython3

    data_path = get_data_path("flygym", "data")
    with open(data_path / "behavior" / "210902_pr_fly1.pkl", "rb") as f:
        data = pickle.load(f)

The dataset is provided at 2000 Hz. We will try to run the simulation at
:math:`\Delta t=0.0001s` (10000 Hz), so let’s interpolate it 5x:

.. code:: ipython3

    target_num_steps = int(run_time / timestep)
    data_block = np.zeros((len(actuated_joints), target_num_steps))
    input_t = np.arange(len(data["joint_LFCoxa"])) * data["meta"]["timestep"]
    output_t = np.arange(target_num_steps) * timestep
    for i, joint in enumerate(actuated_joints):
        data_block[i, :] = np.interp(output_t, input_t, data[joint])

We can visualize the time series of DoF angles:

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axs = plt.subplots(
        3, 2, figsize=(8, 6), sharex=True, sharey=True, tight_layout=True
    )
    legs = [
        f"{side} {pos} leg"
        for pos in ["front", "middle", "hind"]
        for side in ["Left", "Right"]
    ]
    for i, leg in enumerate(legs):
        ax = axs.ravel()[i]
        leg_code = f"{leg.split()[0][0]}{leg.split()[1][0]}".upper()
        for j, dof in enumerate(actuated_joints):
            if dof.split("_")[1][:2] != leg_code:
                continue
            ax.plot(output_t, np.rad2deg(data_block[j, :]), label=dof[8:])
        ax.set_ylim(-180, 180)
        ax.set_xlabel("Time (s)")
        ax.set_ylabel("Angle (degree)")
        ax.set_yticks([-180, -90, 0, 90, 180])
        ax.set_title(leg)
        if leg == "Right front leg":
            ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.04, 0.5), loc="center left", borderaxespad=0)
    
    output_dir = Path("outputs/gym_basics/")
    output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    fig.savefig(output_dir / "kin_replay_joint_dof_time_series.png")



.. image:: https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/_media/blob/main/flygym/gym_basics/kin_replay_joint_dof_time_series.png?raw=true


Now we can create a NeuroMechFly simulation instance and play out the
recorded kinematics in the MDP loop:

.. code:: ipython3

    fly = Fly(init_pose="stretch", actuated_joints=actuated_joints, control="position")
    cam = ZStabilizedCamera(
        attachment_point=fly.model.worldbody, camera_name="camera_left",
        targeted_fly_names=[fly.name], play_speed=0.1
    )
    sim = SingleFlySimulation(
        fly=fly,
        cameras=[cam],
    )
    obs, info = sim.reset()
    for i in trange(target_num_steps):
        # here, we simply use the recorded joint angles as the target joint angles
        joint_pos = data_block[:, i]
        action = {"joints": joint_pos}
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = sim.step(action)
        sim.render()


.. parsed-literal::

    100%|██████████| 10000/10000 [00:27<00:00, 364.28it/s]


To save the rendered video:

.. code:: ipython3

    cam.save_video(output_dir / "kinematic_replay.mp4")


.. raw:: html

   <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeLy-EPFL/_media/main/flygym/gym_basics/kinematic_replay.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 400px;"></video>

We can inspect the observation at the last step to see if they are
consistent with our expectations:

.. code:: ipython3

    for k, v in obs.items():
        print(f"{k}: shape {v.shape}")


.. parsed-literal::

    joints: shape (3, 42)
    fly: shape (4, 3)
    contact_forces: shape (30, 3)
    end_effectors: shape (6, 3)
    fly_orientation: shape (3,)


The basic NeuroMechFly simulation always returns 0 as the reward. It
always returns False for the ``terminated`` and ``truncated`` flags. The
``info`` is also empty. The user can extend the ``NeuroMechFly`` class
to modify these behaviors.

.. code:: ipython3

    print(f"reward: {reward}")
    print(f"terminated: {terminated}")
    print(f"truncated: {truncated}")
    print(f"info: {info}")


.. parsed-literal::

    reward: 0
    terminated: False
    truncated: False
    info: {}
