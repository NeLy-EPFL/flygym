    "**Summary:** In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how one can build controllers at different levels of abstraction by implementing Gym environments encoding variable amounts of preprogrammed computation. As an example, we will refactor the code we wrote in the [hybrid controller tutorial](https://neuromechfly.org/tutorials/hybrid_controller.html#building-a-hybrid-controller) and implement turning by asymmetrically modulating the amplitude and frequency of CPGs."

    "So far, we have interacted with the `NeuroMechFly` class which implements the [Gym interface](https://gymnasium.farama.org/): it has an action space (input given by the user), an observation space (output returned to the user), a `.step(...)` method, a `.reset(...)` method, and a `.render(...)` method. The action and observation spaces of `NeuroMechFly` are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action space:\n",
    "    - \"joints\": 42-dimensional real vector ∈ [0, 2π] indicating joint angles (in default position control mode)\n",
    "    - \"adhesion\": 6-dimensional integer vector ∈ {0, 1} indicating whether adhesion is turned on for each leg\n",
    "- Observation space:\n",
    "    - \"joints\": shape (3, 42) real array indicating joint angles (0th row), velocities (1st row), and torques (2nd row)\n",
    "    - \"fly\": shape (4, 3) real array indicating fly xyz positions (0th row), xyz velocities (1st row), yaw-pitch-roll angles (2nd row), and yaw-pitch-roll velocities (3rd row)\n",
    "    - \"contact_forces\": shape (N, 3) - contact forces, in xyz directions, of the N segments defined in `contact_sensor_placements`\n",
    "    - \"end_effectors\": shape (6, 3) - xyz positions of the six legs in the order of LF, LM LH, RF, RM, RH\n",
    "    - \"fly_orientation\": shape (3,) - unit vector indicating the fly's heading orientation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The FlyGym package is designed to be expandable: the user can implement their own Gym environments with different action and observation spaces and implement different logics (eg. preprogrammed premotor computation and sensory processing). This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

    "In the hybrid controller that [we have implemented](https://neuromechfly.org/tutorials/hybrid_controller.html#building-a-hybrid-controller), the underlying CPG network and the correction mechanisms can be considered the user-defined premotor computation (purple). The whole controller can be considered the box indicating the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Here, we will add a 2D descending signal that encodes turning. The action and observation spaces of our MDP \"box\" are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action space: a 2-dimensional real vector describing the velocity on each side of the body. Although in principle the range of the amplitude is unrestricted, its absolute value shouldn't go far beyond 1 because otherwise the steps become very unrealistic.\n",
    "- Observation space: same as above (no sensory processing logic indicated in cyan)"

    "## Approach for turning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a 2-dimensional representation of descending signals $[\\delta_L, \\delta_R] \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ to modulate the amplitude and direction of the leg CPGs on each side of the body. Specifically, we will modulate the intrinsic amplitude $R'$ and intrinsic frequency $\\nu'$ on each side by:\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, the magnitude of the descending signal controls the amplitude of stepping (as a gain applied to the originally recorded step size); the sign of the descending signal controls the direction of stepping. Of course, this is a very simplified model of turning. Perhaps the most unrealistic aspect of it is that it assumes that the step size spans linearly from 0 to 1x the recorded \"real\" step size. This is an area for future improvement."

    "## Implementing the `HybridTurningController` class\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea of the Gym interface is that it allows users to encapsulate the control logic in a Gym environment (a MDP), and expose only the input and output (action and observation) to the controller. This is achieved using [class inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp) in Python. Briefly, it allows a new class (subclass or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or parent class), enabling code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Refer to the tutorial linked above to familiarize yourself with this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Gym environments inherit from the `gymnasium.Env` class. You can refer to [the API reference of this class](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium-env) for a full specification, or [this page](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/environment_creation/) for a tutorial on how to make your own custom environment. The `NeuroMechFly` class we have used so far inherits from it and therefore complies with its specifications. Here, we will build a `HybridTurningController` class that inherits from `NeuroMechFly` to provide a simplified interface to control turning via a 2D input space, which can be interpreted as a descending code.\n",
